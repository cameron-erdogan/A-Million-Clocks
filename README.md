# A-Million-Clocks
A openFrameworks implementation of the "A Million Times" physical art installation

Upon seeing the "A Million Times" art piece (http://www.humanssince1982.com/a-million-times), I was inspired into making my own using openFrameworks. Here's a demo of what my version does right now: https://vimeo.com/182173986

The demo I have right now isn't terribly exciting, but I'm planning on adding new features and doing crazier stuff with it in the future. 

I'm developing this using the mac version of openFrameworks, so to edit and run my code you'll need XCode.
