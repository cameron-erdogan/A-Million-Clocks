A openFrameworks implementation of the "A Million Times" physical art installation

Upon seeing the "A Million Times" art piece (http://www.humanssince1982.com/a-million-times), I was inspired into making my own using openFrameworks.

I'm developing this using the mac version of openFrameworks, so to edit and run my code you'll need XCode.
